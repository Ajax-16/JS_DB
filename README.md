# NueDB Server

NueDB is a relational database system designed to provide a flexible service through SQL-style commands and an HTTP interface for direct interaction with the database. Its capabilities extend to consuming resources from any JSON-formatted REST API endpoint, transforming the data into a series of dynamic table insertions. Additionally, NueDB integrates a query language with a control structure system, enabling users to repeat or condition actions as needed.

## Features
- **SQL-style Commands**: Users can interact with a NueDB server using **NQL** (Nue Query Language), which closely resembles SQL syntax. This similarity facilitates ease of use and adoption among users familiar with SQL.
- **HTTP Interface**: NueDB offers an HTTP interface, allowing direct communication with the database over the web.

## Future Features

- **REST API Integration**: The system will consume resources from any JSON-formatted REST API endpoint, transforming the data into dynamic table insertions.
- **Dynamic Table Creation**: New tables and relationships will be dynamically created to accommodate data from REST API endpoints, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- **Query Language with Control Structures**: NueDB will evolve NQL to incorporate control structures, empowering users to iterate actions and apply conditional logic. At this stage, it will be referred to as **NSQL** (Nue Scripted Query Language), emphasizing its advanced scripting capabilities beyond standard SQL.
